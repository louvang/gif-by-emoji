## About Code

Gif By Emoji uses the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) to generate a .gif file based on a keyword tied to an emoji. The code is fairly short and simple with a function that grabs the URL of the gif from the API and displays it.

Event listeners are added to each emoji. When clicked, the 'emotion' of the emoji appears in text beneath the .gif image and an active marker is applied to the current emoji selected.
